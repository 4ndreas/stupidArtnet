# stupidArtnet

(Very) Simple Artnet implementation in Python

### Notes

This is meant for testing ground only and is probably not very efficient <br />
Artnet libraries tend to be complicated and hard to get off the ground, for any serious work I would recommend
[ArtnetLibs](https://github.com/OpenLightingProject/libartnet) <br />
[Python Wrapper for Artnet Libs](https://github.com/haum/libartnet)
